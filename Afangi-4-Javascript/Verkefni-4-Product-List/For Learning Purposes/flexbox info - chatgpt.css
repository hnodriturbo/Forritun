If these divs are direct children of .addProductRow, and you want to control their flex behavior as part of the row, you don't need to set display: flex; on each of these divs themselves (unless you have specific reasons to control the layout of elements within them). Instead, ensure .addProductRow is the flex container:

css
Copy code
.addProductRow {
    display: flex;
    gap: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}
And then control the width or flex properties of the child divs (.addProductName, .addProductPrice, .addProductButton) to distribute space as desired, for example:

css
Copy code
.addProductRow > .addProductName { flex: 6; } /* 60% */
.addProductRow > .addProductPrice { flex: 3; } /* 30% */
.addProductRow > .addProductButton { flex: 1; } /* 10% */
Or set specific flex-basis if you are aiming for precise control:

css
Copy code
.addProductRow > .addProductName { flex: 0 0 60%; }
.addProductRow > .addProductPrice { flex: 0 0 30%; }
.addProductRow > .addProductButton { flex: 0 0 10%; }
This approach ensures that your .addProductRow acts as a flex container, and the child divs are flex items laid out according to Flexbox rules, without mistakenly applying display: flex; to the children unless you intend to manage the layout of elements within those children specifically.

describe these three arguments and what they do for me

ChatGPT
When you specify the flex property for a flex item, you're actually using a shorthand that combines three different properties: flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. This shorthand allows for more concise and readable CSS when configuring flexible layouts. Here's what each of these three arguments does:

1. flex-grow
What It Does: Defines the ability of a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates how much of the available space in the flex container should be assigned to the item (relative to other flex items).
Example: If one item has a flex-grow value of 1 and another item has a flex-grow value of 2, the second item will grow to take up twice as much of the available space as the first item.
2. flex-shrink
What It Does: Determines the ability of a flex item to shrink if necessary. Like flex-grow, it accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It indicates how much the flex item should shrink relative to the rest of the flex items in the flex container when there isn't enough space.
Example: If one item has a flex-shrink value of 1 and another item has a flex-shrink value of 3, the second item will shrink three times as much as the first item when necessary.
3. flex-basis
What It Does: Sets the initial main size of a flex item before the remaining space is distributed according to flex-grow and flex-shrink. It can be a length (e.g., 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword such as auto, which means the size is based on the item's content or specific properties.
Example: If flex-basis is set to auto, the starting size of the item will depend on its content size or specified dimensions. If set to 0, the starting size is 0, and its size is entirely determined by the flex-grow value and the available space.
Shorthand flex Property
The flex property combines these three values into one declaration. For example, flex: 1 0 10%; means:

flex-grow: 1;: The item can grow to fill available space if necessary.
flex-shrink: 0;: The item will not shrink, regardless of the available space.
flex-basis: 10%;: The starting main size of the item is 10% of the flex container's main size.
Understanding how to manipulate these properties allows for precise control over the distribution of space within a flex container, making Flexbox a powerful tool for responsive design and complex layouts.
